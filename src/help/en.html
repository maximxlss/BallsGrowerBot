Do you want to have the biggest balls in the world? I'm sure you do. Just /grow them once a day in every chat you're in! Get on the top the rank!

The growth range for the command is between <b>{grow_min}</b> and <b>{grow_max}</b> cm. Use the /top command to show the top of the biggest testicules in a chat.

Also, there is a daily election of <i>the Balls of the Day</i> in every chat. This title brings its owner some bonus centimeters squared additionally. Only active players who have grown their spheres at least once in the last week participate in the election.

If you want to make your little balls even bigger and is ready to get some risk for this opportunity, you may fight with your friends. Just place a bet via /pvp command! The winner will get the specified number of centimeters squared. The looser will lose theirs. It's simple.

<b>The administrator of the chat, I participate in, doesn't allow to add unknown bots</b>

There is a way to play without the bot being in a chat at all! Just use inline queries! Type the username of the bot after the <code>@</code> sign and a trailing space to get the same commands!

<b>Contacts and links</b>

In case of any problems, write to {admin_username} or create an issue in the source code repository.

The source code of the bot, written in Rust, is available on GitHub under a bit modified MIT license, forbidding the use of the code to create competitor bots or take a commercial profit by any ways: {git_repo}

<b>For those who are stuck very deep below minus</b>

Since release <a href="https://github.com/kozalosev/DickGrowerBot/releases/tag/v1.2.0">1.2</a>, there is no way anymore to accept a fight with a bet greater than the size of your weapon. However, many of you are already below zero very much. To smooth out this issue, the following measures were taken:
1️⃣ every growth will be increased by <b>{help_pussies_percentage}%</b> of the "debt";
2️⃣ as an alternative option, the /loan command has been added, allowing you to reset your little sis to zero on credit, which will be gradually paid out by each subsequent growth.
